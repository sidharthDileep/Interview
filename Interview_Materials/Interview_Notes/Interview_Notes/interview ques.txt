introduction

in that I have mention my project so starting question was from microservices

1.feign client

2.how to call a microservice from another other than feign client

3.api gateway

4. how we can create it and how it it accessible to the user

5.how to use load balancing and how I have used that in my project

java 8 feature

Java Stream intermediate and terminal function

filter uses which function

Java Stream implementation:-

1.from a list we have to find the occurrence and print them according to occurrence and if two number occurrence are same so smaller one should come first.

2. from a array list create 2 array list one of odd number one of even

collection - set, list , map which we have used in that

flow of microservice and annotations used with explanation

jpa repository is class or interface

how we create a native query

security -oauth,oauth2,jwt
