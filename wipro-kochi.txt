pathparameter and query parameter diff?
stateless and stateful?

A Stateful bean will have state associated with it for each request from the same client. 
Stateless beans have no client specific state and a single instance could be used concurrently, threadsafe, between multiple clients requests.

Also, what is the difference between stateful and stateless?

In Stateless, server is not needed to keep the server information or session details to itself. In stateful, a server is required to maintain the current state and session information. 
In stateless, server and client are loosely coupled and can act independently. In stateful, server and client are tightly bound.

Also, what is stateful and stateless applications? A stateless app is an application program that does not save client data generated in one session for use in the next session with that client. 
In contrast, a stateful application saves data about each client session and uses that data the next time the client makes a request.

Stateless object is an instance of a class without instance fields (instance variables). The class may have fields, but they are compile-time constants (static final). 
Immutable objects may have state, but it does not change when a method is invoked (method invocations do not assign new values to fields).

Is HTTP stateful or stateless?

HTTP is a stateless protocol, in other word the server will forget everything related to client/browser state. 
Although web applications have made it virtually look like stateful. A stateless protocol can be forced to behave as if it were stateful.
