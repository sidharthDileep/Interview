what are the challenges you faces and how did you overcome?

your contribution?

How did you fix the last bug in the app?
there was a mismatch in the total count, success count and error count. the tester reported the issue in the logging statement.

commercialCredit recieve info from experian. So, we took the data from the response and map it to the CommercialCredit response. 
we will do some calculations, creditNumber is calculated. in some edge cases of the value, one attributes needs to be changed. I missed that.
depending on the products and address
