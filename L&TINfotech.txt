scopes? difference?
The scope of a bean defines the life cycle and visibility of that bean in the contexts we use it.

The latest version of the Spring framework defines 6 types of scopes:

singleton
prototype
request
session
application
websocket
The last four scopes mentioned, request, session, application and websocket, are only available in a web-aware application.
